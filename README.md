# BumperCars

A simple game made in JavaFX. The game features two cars and a ball inside a field. Each car has a goal to defend and must try to score on the opponent's goal to get points.

One car is controlled by the user and accelerates according to which arrow keys are pressed. The other car is "AI" controlled and will steer towards the location of the ball.
